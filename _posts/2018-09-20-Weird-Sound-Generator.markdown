After making some guitar pedals I decided to build something bigger. My interest slightly moved to synthesizers and their analog sound which I enjoy a lot. I was thinking about to making one but they were so complicated and timeconsuming to build. So, I decided to make something that would be as an introduction to me. "Music From Outer Space" [MFOS](http://musicfromouterspace.com/) is a great site to find such a project to build. There are a lot of cool synthesizer projects in their site. Weird Sound Generator is a elementary project and you can find all the schematics and build instructions on MFOS site. Link --> [WSG](http://musicfromouterspace.com/index.php?MAINTAB=SYNTHDIY&PROJARG=WSG2010/wsg_page1.html&VPW=1338&VPH=500)

Weird Sound Generator(WSG) basically has 2 oscilator and some modulation units on each oscilator. It is really fun to play with it. You can see from below video, I am randomly tweaking all the pots and switches to make crazy sounds. You can scare your neighbours off with that if you want.. :)
