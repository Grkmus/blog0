After making a few guitar pedals, I decided to take on something bigger. My interest shifted toward synthesizers and their analog sounds, which I enjoy a lot. I wanted to build one, but full synthesizers are complicated and time-consuming projects. So, I decided to start with something simpler as an introduction. "Music From Outer Space" ([MFOS](http://musicfromouterspace.com/)) is a fantastic site for DIY synth projects. They have a variety of cool synthesizer projects. I chose the Weird Sound Generator (WSG), a beginner-friendly project, and you can find all the schematics and build instructions on the MFOS site: [WSG](http://musicfromouterspace.com/index.php?MAINTAB=SYNTHDIY&PROJARG=WSG2010/wsg_page1.html&VPW=1338&VPH=500).

The Weird Sound Generator (WSG) basically has two oscillators and some modulation units on each one. It’s really fun to play around with. In the video below, you can see me randomly tweaking the knobs and switches to create all sorts of crazy sounds. It’s the perfect way to scare off the neighbors if you’re in the mood! :)
